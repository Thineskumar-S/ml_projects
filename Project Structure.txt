Description:
data/: Contains the data-related files and subdirectories.

raw/: Holds the raw, unprocessed data.
processed/: Stores the processed data after data preprocessing steps.
datasets.py: Contains code for loading and managing datasets.
notebooks/: Contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, experimentation, and visualization. Notebooks can be used to experiment with the code before incorporating it into the main project.

src/: This folder contains the main source code of the project.

data/: Holds the data-related code modules.
models/: Contains the code for defining and managing ML/DL models.
train/: Includes the code for training the models.
evaluate/: Contains code for evaluating and visualizing model performance.
__init__.py: Makes the src folder a Python package.
experiments/: Stores experiment-related files and logs. You can use this folder to save model checkpoints, logs, and experiment records.

results/: Contains the results of model evaluations, performance metrics, and any other relevant outputs.

config/: Contains configuration files.

hyperparameters.yaml: Stores hyperparameters for the models, optimizer settings, etc.
config.yaml: Holds general project configurations.
requirements.txt: Lists the required Python libraries and their versions for the project. Useful for setting up a virtual environment.

main.py: The entry point of the project. It brings all the modules together, sets up the ML/DL pipeline, and runs the training and evaluation.

README.md: A markdown file explaining the project's overview, instructions, and other relevant information.

With this intermediate-level directory structure, your project becomes more organized, and it's easier to manage different components separately. As your project grows, you can extend the structure further to accommodate additional features and functionality. Remember to add comments and docstrings in your code to improve readability and maintainability.
